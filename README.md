# algorithm-project


In this project, we are making a pseudo-code algorithm to count characters in a sentence. The code executes under the assumption that there is at least ONE word in the sentence that ends with a ".", and that they're all lower case.

The logic behind it: using the counters (j for vowels, k for words, and i for characters), we are going through the sentence letter by letter (through the use of c), incrementing the character counter (i) each time, and incremeneting the word counter (k) whenever we find a space, and lastly, incrementing the vowel counter (j) whenever a vowel is met that's inside the character table (char_table).

We make sure to write all the results at the end of our execution.

The usage of array before reaching the data structures part was for code simplicity's sake.
